# Sudoku Solver

This is a simple project I decided to try out in order to improve.
It solves a 9 x 9 sudoku grid using a backtracking algorithm.

## How to use
 - Run `make` at the root of the repository
 - Run `./sudoku <grid>` where `<grid>` is a text file containing your grid.

*Note: Empty cells on the grid should be replaced by a period (.)*
